 We at war
 We at war with terrorism, racism
 But most of all we at war with ourselves
 
 <p>[Chorus]
 (Jesus, walk)
 God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
 (Jesus, walk with me)</p>
 
 <p>[Verse 1]
 You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
 Where restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace
 And next these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus
 Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is
 I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
 Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
 Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
 Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
 They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
 Sayin' "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
 Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
 We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
 A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
 My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
 Well mama I know I act a fool
 But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move
 I hope</p>
